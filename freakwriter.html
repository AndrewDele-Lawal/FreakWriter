<!-- 
 
Language: HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

ðŸ§  Paradigm:

Declarative (not procedural or object-oriented)
* Similar to SQL in that manner *

You describe the structure and content of a web page, not how it behaves or runs step by step.
* You can do this with Javascript *

HTML is not a programming language â€” itâ€™s a markup language used to define the layout and structure of content.
*There are no Logical operations, data manipulation, or ways to change the flow of the program*

ðŸ“Œ Key Characteristics:
Markup-based: Uses tags (like <h1>, <p>, <div>) to define elements on a page.

Static: By itself, HTML cannot handle logic, loops, or interactivity. Itâ€™s purely for content and structure.

Hierarchical: HTML documents are structured as a tree of nested elements (DOM tree).

Paired with CSS & JavaScript: HTML builds the skeleton, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity.
*The way I see this is like HTML is solely a header file where you initialize the structure of what you want
Then afterwards you use CSS and JavaScript to actually make it happen*

Interpreted by browsers: No need to compile â€” just write the code, save the .html file, and open it in any web browser.
