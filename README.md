Hi All! Thanks for viewing this repository. This is my attempt to revisit web design.
I utilized JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
The premise is a possessed typewriter that takes a user's input and cuts it a little above half. It would then output the message, pause briefly, and type one of the pre-curated jump scares. Lastly, it would correct itself, erasing the jumpscare and typing the rest of your message.
I hope you enjoy and let me know if there is anything I can change or just any general suggestions to make it better!
